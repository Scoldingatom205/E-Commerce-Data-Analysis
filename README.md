# Executive Performance Insights: Superstore Overview

# Background
Founded in 2014, SuperStore quickly became a leader in e-commerce, specializing in furniture, office supplies, and technology. By late 2017, the companyâ€™s impressive year-over-year growth signaled readiness for international expansion. To realize this vision, SuperStore needed to upgrade its data infrastructure to support global-scale analysis and reporting.

## Key Business Questions:
- How do we upgrade the data infrastructure so that Superstore can get reports faster?
- How are sales performing in each continent, category, segment, or subcategory year-over-year?
- Which products are costing us? Which are performing well?
- Who are our most profitable customers?
- What does our sales projection look like for next year by continent, category, and segment?
- What subcategories or products are most sold together?

### End Goal: 
Transform SuperStore's data operations from a traditional Excel-based approach to a sophisticated, cloud-driven analytics system to enhance performance tracking, support international expansion, and enable data-driven decision-making.

### Dataset Structure
Appended, data modeled, and analyzed two datasets:
- United States Data: 10,000 rows
- International Data: 50,000 rows
