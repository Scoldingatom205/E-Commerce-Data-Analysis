# SuperStore Executive Performance Insights: Superstore Overview
End-to-End Data Project

# End Goal: 

## Background
Founded in 2014, SuperStore is an e-commerce department store specializing in reliable furniture, office supplies, and technological products serving thousands of custmers across the United States. In late 2017, the founder strongly believed international expansion was the next move as SuperStore has experienced sales growth YoY. 

They hired a few data people including myself at the end of 2017 to help with their global expansion. I knew very well that if expansion was experienced they way they describe it, then the company would not survive on Excel sheets.

## Part 1: Excel Dashboard & Full Revamp
My initial task was to create an executive summary performance report for 2017, comparing it with 2016, presented in a dashboard. Previously, SuperStore's data was consolidated in a single Excel worksheet, which was inefficient and cumbersome for performance checks.

To optimize this, I implemented a data model using multiple worksheets: Orders, Product, Customer, and Shipment. This reorganization made pivot tables/charts more efficient, organized the data, and reduced redundancy. The interactive dashboard I created highlights the best and worst performing cities, subcategories, and products, with filters for categories, regions, discount classes, and more.
