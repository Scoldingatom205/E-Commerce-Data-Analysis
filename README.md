# End-to-End-Data-Project: Superstore

## Background
SuperStore is an e-commerce department store specializing in reliable furniture, office supplies, and technological products. The SuperStore team is a small group, including the founder, upper management, product/warehouse managers, and salespeople. After experiencing great success in the US, the founder believes it's time to expand internationally. I joined the team in late 2017 as the Head of Analytics to support this expansion.

## Part 1: Excel Dashboard & Full Revamp
My initial task was to create an executive summary performance report for 2017, comparing it with 2016, presented in a dashboard. Previously, SuperStore's data was consolidated in a single Excel worksheet, which was inefficient and cumbersome for performance checks.

To optimize this, I implemented a data model using multiple worksheets: Orders, Product, Customer, and Shipment. This reorganization made pivot tables/charts more efficient, organized the data, and reduced redundancy. The interactive dashboard I created highlights the best and worst performing cities, subcategories, and products, with filters for categories, regions, discount classes, and more.

## Part 2: Python
