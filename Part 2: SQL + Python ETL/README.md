# Documentation Part 2:  Python ETL

**Tools & Dependencies Used:** Google Colab, pandas, numpy, string, hash

# Overview
**Narrative:** After 2017, SuperStore felt it was time to expand internationally. To realize this vision, SuperStore needed to upgrade its data infrastructure to support global-scale analysis and reporting. 

**Reality:** I was using a SuperStore dataset solely in the United States. Then I found another dataset that was bigger and was not only limited to the United States.
